    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chef John's handkerchief lasagna is made with paper-thin homemade pasta
      sheets, folded over a delicate ricotta filling and a light amount of pasta
      sauce. These filled "handkerchiefs" are then layered to create one of the
      best versions of lasagna ever.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>3 cups prepared marianara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a pile of flour on a work surface, and make a well in the center.
        Add eggs to the well, and scramble eggs with a fork, gradually
        incorporating flour from the edges. When the dough becomes too thick to
        use a fork, use a bench scraper to lift remaining dry flour over the top
        and begin to cut flour in until a shaggy dough forms.\
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead dough by hand until to form a smooth ball, about 3 minutes. Cover
        and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until a very smooth and elastic
        ball of dough forms, about 4 minutes more. The dough recipe makes enough
        for 2 lasagnas; divide dough in half; wrap tightly and rest 1 piece of
        dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
        Freeze remaining dough for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        For cheese filling, add ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, parsley, salt,
        black pepper, and cayenne to a bowl, and stir together until evenly
        combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
