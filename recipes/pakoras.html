    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've
      ever had Japanese tempura-coated veggies. These pakoras are similar, but
      the spiced batter gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce, mint
      yogurt sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. Try this recipe with other
      vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chickpea flour</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>½ head cauliflower florets</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, sliced into rings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift chickpea flour into a medium bowl; mix in garlic, salt, coriander,
        turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala. Make a well in the center;
        gradually pour water into the well and mix to form a thick, smooth
        batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees
        F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While the oil is heating, dip cauliflower florets and onion rings in
        batter to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Working in small batches, fry battered vegetables in hot oil until
        golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels before
        serving.
      </li>
